### Some recent Mozilla projects I am very proud of ...

- 🔭 I am a founding team member of [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios) and later managed team. We worked on many releases of this great browser for your iPhone and iPad. You can download it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926).
- 🌱 I came up with the idea for [Firefox Focus for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-ios). I contributed to it's development and also managed the team. After a short break, this product is now being modernized by my team and I try to make technical contributions.
- 👯 I built and managed the [Mozilla Android Components](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components) team, responsible for building a rock solid foundation for our Android Browsers, including [Firefox for Android (Fenix)](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix) and [Focus for Android](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android).

> None of these projects would be a success without the contributions of my team members, colleagues and contributors who have put in countless hours and insane amounts of energy.

### Some fun side projects ...



- 🍎 I worked on an 6502 Emulator called the [Emulated Woz Machine (EWM)](https://github.com/st3fan/ewm) that can run Apple I and Apple II+ software like Frogger, Hard Hat Mack, Jaw Breaker and Burger Time. I wrote a [series of blog posts](https://stefan.arentz.ca/posts/) about it's development.
- 📺 I wrote a ["Sad Mac" screen saver](https://stefan.arentz.ca/posts/2018-09-21-sadmac/) for macOS to bring back some nostalgia. Technically not impressive but a lot of fun to look at.
- ⌚️ I shipped [AstroNote](https://astronote.app), a tiny WatchOS app with a REST API to send notifications to your wrist.
