### 🦊 Some Mozilla projects I am proud to be part of ...

- 🔥 I am a founding team member of [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios) and later managed the team. We worked on many releases of this great browser for your iPhone and iPad. You can download it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926).
- 🤫 I came up with the idea for [Firefox Focus for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-ios). I contributed to it's development and also managed the team. After a short break, the iOS version is now being modernized by my team.
- 🎂 I (interim) managed the engineering team that shipped [Fenix 1.0](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/06/27/reinventing-firefox-for-android-a-preview/), a full rewrite of Firefox for Android. The [1.0 release was tagged](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and celebrated on the last day of our company all-hands meeting in Whistler, July 2019 🐻🥂 That was a very proud moment after the amazing engineering team did a [mountain of work](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/compare/v0.1...v1.0.0) 🏔
- 📦 I built, managed and grew the [Mozilla Android Components](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components) team, responsible for building a rock solid foundation for our Android Browsers, including [Firefox for Android (Fenix)](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix) and [Focus for Android](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android).

> None of these projects would be a success without the contributions from team members, colleagues and contributors who have put in countless hours and insane amounts of energy 🦊 ❤️

### 😎 Some fun side projects that I've worked on over the years ...

- 🍎 I worked on an 6502 Emulator called the [Emulated Woz Machine (EWM)](https://github.com/st3fan/ewm) that can run Apple I and Apple II+ software like Frogger, Hard Hat Mack, Jaw Breaker and Burger Time. I wrote a [series of blog posts](https://stefan.arentz.ca/posts/) about it's development. (Plain Old C)
- 📺 I wrote a ["Sad Mac" screen saver](https://stefan.arentz.ca/posts/2018-09-21-sadmac/) for macOS to bring back some nostalgia. Technically not impressive but a lot of fun to look at. (Objective-C)
- ⌚️ I shipped [AstroNote](https://astronote.app), a tiny WatchOS app with a REST API to send notifications to your wrist. (Swift, Go)
